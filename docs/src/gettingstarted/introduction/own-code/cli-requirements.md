Now that you have created your free trial account, you are able to push your application to Platform.sh once you have installed the CLI.

Before you install it, there are some requirements that must be met first.

You need to have:

* [PHP 5.5.9+](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) with the following extensions installed: `curl`, `json`, `mbstring`, `pcre`, and `phar`.
* [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git). It's is the open source version control system used to manage any changes you make to your project. You can see all the Git commit messages of an environment in the `Environment Activity` feed of the [management console](/administration/web/_index.md) for each project you create.
* A Bash-like shell.

On Windows, to install PHP and Git you can use [chocolatey](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/). The best way to get Bash is through [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about).
