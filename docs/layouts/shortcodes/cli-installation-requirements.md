You need to have:

* PHP 5.5.9+
* Git
* A Bash-like shell

  On Windows, the best way to get Bash is through [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about).
  You can also use another Bash-compatible shell such as [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/),
  which you might have installed with git.

For full requirements, see the [requirements on GitHub](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli#user-content-requirements).
