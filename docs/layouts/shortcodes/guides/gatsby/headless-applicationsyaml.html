<p>You can optionally combine the application configuration (<code>.platform.app.yaml</code>) for Gatsby and {{ .Get "name" }} into a <a href="/create-apps/multi-app.html#unified-app-configuration"> single configuration file</a> (<code>applications.yaml</code>). Like <code>services.yaml</code> and <code>routes.yaml</code>, this file is shared across the project and resides in the <code>.platform</code> subdirectory. It does require that you explicitly define the source of each application.</p>
